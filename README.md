## ü¶äüì¶ foxbox

foxbox is a simplistic, rootless process isolation runtime and CLI tool
based on Linux user namespaces.

It‚Äôs a fun project created to explore and better understand what‚Äôs behind
the high-level abstractions of existing container runtimes like Docker or
Podman.

A lot of the initial process isolation code is based on [Liz Rice‚Äôs
‚ÄúContainers From Scratch‚Äù][lizrice], [Lizzie Dixon‚Äôs Linux containers in
500 lines of code‚Äù][lizzie500], and runc‚Äôs [libcontainer][runc].

Note: better not use foxbox in prod. I run shady fluff in prod and even I
wouldn‚Äôt run this there (yet, hehe).

## Terminology

Purely for fun, containers are named _foxboxes_ (or _boxes_ for short).
Likewise, tasks in containers are just called _foxes_.

## Usage

For now, clone the repo and then run `go run ./cmd/foxbox` to access the
cli tool.

To run a foxbox, you need a compatible image. So far, I‚Äôve only used the
[alpine 3.18.4 rootfs][alpine]. Download that rootfs to `./images` The
resulting file name excluding the file extention (must be `.tar` or
`.tar.gz`), e.g. `alpine-minirootfs-3.18.4-x86_64` is the image name in
foxbox.

To create a foxbox and run a shell, execute the following in the project
root:

```sh
go run ./cmd/foxbox run --rm alpine-3.18.4-x86_64
```

Run the `hostname` to get the box name. To find the rootfs, head to
`./runtime/BOXNAME/boxfs` on the host machine, where `BOXNAME` is the
hostname of the box.

## Features

While interop is really cool, I‚Äôm not planning to make foxbox compatible
with the OCI runtime spec, though it might be a fun challenge later on.

### Nice-to-haves

- [ ] (maybe) Use [OCI Image Format][ociif] for images
